    "descriptionB": "üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi! I'm a level 4 Software Engineer, meaning I've racked up 4+ years of real-world coding experience, on an epic quest to code for eternity. Fueled by a love for solving arcane bugs and taming wild logic, I thrive in the chaos of complexity. The harder the boss fight (aka the problem), the more thrilling the victory. No bug too sneaky, no refactor too bold ‚Äî even if I have to loop back to square one and respawn with a whole new strategy. üíæüõ†Ô∏è",
